					<h4>Do your tours include international airfare?</h4>
					<p>Travelers arrive from all over the world to begin our tours and it is not possible to include international airfare in our prices. We would be happy to help you arrange flights. Just ask for an air quote when making your booking.</p>
					
					<h4>What vaccinations are recommended for this adventure?</h4>
					<p>t's important that you receive the most accurate and up-to-date travel health information for the region you will be visiting. The only one qualified to provide you with this advice is your family physician or a specialist from a Travel Health clinic. Our Resources page does provide links to a number of websites that contain excellent background information related to travel health issues. Nevertheless these websites are no substitute for a personal consultation with a qualified medical professional.</p>
					
					<h4>Can you help arrange my travel visas?</h4>
					<p>Requirements for travel visas vary widely depending on your nationality and your destination. Although we are unable to arrange visas on your behalf we have provided links on our “Resources” page to websites that will help you determine if visas are required. If you do require a visa you can arrange them yourself or use the services of a travel agent or visa processing company.</p>
					
					<h4>What clothing should I pack for one of your adventures?</h4>
					<p>We always recommend packing as light as possible however the specific requirements for your tour will vary widely depending on where and when you are traveling. Our 'Trip Details' document includes a suggested packing list and these can be downloaded from each individual trip summary page. The checklist is tour specific and based upon the experience of our ground staff.</p>
					
					<h4>What is the most appropriate type of luggage to bring?</h4>
					<p>We strongly recommend bringing a backpack or duffel bag, as suitcases can be cumbersome and difficult to store in buses, under seats, etc.. Keep in mind that you will normally have to carry your own luggage on and off buses and trains and up and down hotel staircases. Suitcases with wheels may not work well on dirt or cobblestone roads.</p>
					
					<h4>What type of ground transportation is used on your tours?</h4>
					<p>Trip specific information on transportation can be found on the trip summary page however in most cases we use public transportation. We've found that how you get there significantly influences the tone of your journey and public transportation allows face-to-face interaction with the local people. Some of our adventures, including our “Superior”, "Comfort Class" and most adventures in Africa, use private transportation.</p>
					
					<h4>Are airport transfers included?</h4>
					<p>Most of our adventures do not include airport transfers and so we recommend you arrange a taxi on arrival (this is the most economical and efficient way of getting you to your hotel). If you would prefer a pre-arranged transfer these are usually available at an additional cost - please contact us for more information. Some of our adventures, including our “Superior” "Comfort Class", "Independent" and "Family Adventures", include an arrival transfer (departure transfers can be locally arranged at additional cost from the finishing point hotel). </p>
					
					<h4>Can I join a tour late or leave it early?</h4>
					<p>It's extremely difficult if not impossible to join a tour after it has begun. It is possible to leave a tour early however you will be responsible for your own arrangements from the moment you decide to leave the tour. You would also be responsible for all costs associated with joining a tour late or leaving one early. If you feel this may be necessary please consult a specialist before you book your adventure.</p>
